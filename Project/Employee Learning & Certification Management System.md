## Lesson 19 — Employee Learning & Certification Management System (Real Enterprise Project)

> By the end of this lesson, you should have a working Salesforce application with real objects and relationships — not just theory.

### Phase 1 — Requirement → Architecture → Create Application → Create Objects → Create Fields

---

### 0. Before We Build — Understand What We Are Building

Imagine your company says:

> "We want an internal portal where employees can learn courses, managers approve enrollments, HR tracks certifications, and leadership sees dashboards."

As Salesforce Admins, we convert business requirements into Salesforce.

Business:

```
Learning System
```

Salesforce:

```
App
↓
Objects
↓
Fields
↓
Relationships
↓
Security
↓
Automation
↓
Reports
```

---

### 1. Understand the Business Requirement

Company wants employees to:

- Login
- View profile
- Browse courses
- Enroll
- Request approval
- Complete training
- Receive certification
- View progress

Managers should:

- Approve requests
- Monitor teams

HR should:

- Monitor all employees

Admin should:

- Configure system

---

### 2. Convert Requirement into Architecture

Question:

> What data do we need?

Answer:

```
Employee
Course
Enrollment
Certification
Skill
```

Architecture:

```
Employee
│
├──── Skills
│
├──── Certifications
│
└──── Enrollments
           │
           ▼
         Course
```

Meaning:

Employee:

```
One Employee
↓
Many Skills

One Employee
↓
Many Certifications

Many Employees
↓
Many Courses
↓
Enrollment
```

---

### 3. Create the Application (Container)
